## Question 1
In this sketch I creaed a class for "Bubble" which creates an object with its own properties. In this section I used show and move to create the bubble and make it animated. Next in setup I called 5 bubbles and set them equal to a new "Bubble" object with their own parameters. Lastly for them to show up I called the bubbles in draw with move and show so they sill show on the canvas. 

```Javascript
function draw() {
  background(0);
  
  bubble1.move();
  bubble1.show();
  bubble2.move();
  bubble2.show();
  bubble3.move();
  bubble3.show();

}
```
